/**
 * This data source provides the list of Cross Connects in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Core service.
 *
 * Lists the cross-connects in the specified compartment. You can filter the list
 * by specifying the [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of a cross-connect group.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as oci from "@pulumi/oci";
 *
 * const testCrossConnects = oci.GetCoreCrossConnects({
 *     compartmentId: _var.compartment_id,
 *     crossConnectGroupId: oci_core_cross_connect_group.test_cross_connect_group.id,
 *     displayName: _var.cross_connect_display_name,
 *     state: _var.cross_connect_state,
 * });
 * ```
