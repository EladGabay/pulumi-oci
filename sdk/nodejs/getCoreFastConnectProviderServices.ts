/**
 * This data source provides the list of Fast Connect Provider Services in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Core service.
 *
 * Lists the service offerings from supported providers. You need this
 * information so you can specify your desired provider and service
 * offering when you create a virtual circuit.
 *
 * For the compartment ID, provide the [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of your tenancy (the root compartment).
 *
 * For more information, see [FastConnect Overview](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/fastconnect.htm).
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as oci from "@pulumi/oci";
 *
 * const testFastConnectProviderServices = oci.GetCoreFastConnectProviderServices({
 *     compartmentId: _var.compartment_id,
 * });
 * ```
