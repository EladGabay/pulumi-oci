/**
 * This data source provides the list of Budgets in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Budget service.
 *
 * Gets a list of Budgets in a compartment.
 *
 * By default, ListBudgets returns budgets of 'COMPARTMENT' target type and the budget records with only ONE target compartment OCID.
 *
 * To list ALL budgets, set the targetType query parameter to ALL.
 * Example:
 *   'targetType=ALL'
 *
 * Additional targetTypes would be available in future releases. Clients should ignore new targetType
 * or upgrade to latest version of client SDK to handle new targetType.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as oci from "@pulumi/oci";
 *
 * const testBudgets = oci.GetBudgetBudgets({
 *     compartmentId: _var.tenancy_ocid,
 *     displayName: _var.budget_display_name,
 *     state: _var.budget_state,
 *     targetType: _var.budget_target_type,
 * });
 * ```
