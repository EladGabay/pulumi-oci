/**
 * This data source provides details about a specific Listing resource in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Marketplace service.
 *
 * Gets detailed information about a listing, including the listing's name, version, description, and
 * resources.
 *
 * If you plan to launch an instance from an image listing, you must first subscribe to the listing. When
 * you launch the instance, you also need to provide the image ID of the listing resource version that you want.
 *
 * Subscribing to the listing requires you to first get a signature from the terms of use agreement for the
 * listing resource version. To get the signature, issue a [GetAppCatalogListingAgreements](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/api/#/en/iaas/latest/AppCatalogListingResourceVersionAgreements/GetAppCatalogListingAgreements) API call.
 * The [AppCatalogListingResourceVersionAgreements](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/api/#/en/iaas/latest/AppCatalogListingResourceVersionAgreements) object, including
 * its signature, is returned in the response. With the signature for the terms of use agreement for the desired
 * listing resource version, create a subscription by issuing a
 * [CreateAppCatalogSubscription](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/api/#/en/iaas/latest/AppCatalogSubscription/CreateAppCatalogSubscription) API call.
 *
 * To get the image ID to launch an instance, issue a [GetAppCatalogListingResourceVersion](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/api/#/en/iaas/latest/AppCatalogListingResourceVersion/GetAppCatalogListingResourceVersion) API call.
 * Lastly, to launch the instance, use the image ID of the listing resource version to issue a [LaunchInstance](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/api/#/en/iaas/latest/Instance/LaunchInstance) API call.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as oci from "@pulumi/oci";
 *
 * const testListing = oci.GetMarketplaceListing({
 *     listingId: oci_marketplace_listing.test_listing.id,
 *     compartmentId: _var.compartment_id,
 * });
 * ```
