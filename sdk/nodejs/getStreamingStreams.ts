/**
 * This data source provides the list of Streams in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Streaming service.
 *
 * Lists the streams in the given compartment id.
 * If the compartment id is specified, it will list streams in the compartment, regardless of their stream pool.
 * If the stream pool id is specified, the action will be scoped to that stream pool.
 * The compartment id and stream pool id cannot be specified at the same time.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as oci from "@pulumi/oci";
 *
 * const testStreams = oci.GetStreamingStreams({
 *     compartmentId: _var.compartment_id,
 *     id: _var.stream_id,
 *     name: _var.stream_name,
 *     state: _var.stream_state,
 *     streamPoolId: oci_streaming_stream_pool.test_stream_pool.id,
 * });
 * ```
