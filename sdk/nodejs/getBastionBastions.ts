/**
 * This data source provides the list of Bastions in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Bastion service.
 *
 * Retrieves a list of BastionSummary objects in a compartment. Bastions provide secured, public access to target resources in the cloud that you cannot otherwise reach from the internet.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as oci from "@pulumi/oci";
 *
 * const testBastions = oci.GetBastionBastions({
 *     compartmentId: _var.compartment_id,
 *     bastionId: oci_bastion_bastion.test_bastion.id,
 *     bastionLifecycleState: _var.bastion_bastion_lifecycle_state,
 *     name: _var.bastion_name,
 * });
 * ```
