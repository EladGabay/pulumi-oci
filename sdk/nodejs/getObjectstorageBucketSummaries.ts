/**
 * This data source provides the list of Buckets in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Object Storage service.
 *
 * Gets a list of all BucketSummary items in a compartment. A BucketSummary contains only summary fields for the bucket
 * and does not contain fields like the user-defined metadata.
 *
 * ListBuckets returns a BucketSummary containing at most 1000 buckets. To paginate through more buckets, use the returned
 * `opc-next-page` value with the `page` request parameter.
 *
 * To use this and other API operations, you must be authorized in an IAM policy. If you are not authorized,
 * talk to an administrator. If you are an administrator who needs to write policies to give users access, see
 * [Getting Started with Policies](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Identity/Concepts/policygetstarted.htm).
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as oci from "@pulumi/oci";
 *
 * const testBuckets = oci.GetObjectstorageBucketSummaries({
 *     compartmentId: _var.compartment_id,
 *     namespace: _var.bucket_namespace,
 * });
 * ```
